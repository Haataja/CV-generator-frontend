# Building front-end for back-end integration

Before you can build the front-end, you need to install its dependencies.
This can be done with following command from project directory.

`npm install`

After all dependencies are downloaded, you can build the project.
Building the project will create separate directory in project folder called *build*.
To start building, provide this command in project directory.

`npm run build`
